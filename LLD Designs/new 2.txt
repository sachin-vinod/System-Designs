non Functional requirement
1. (concurency)system must deal with race condition in case of dealing with inventory
2. authentication
3. can be taken care of cap theorem
4. reliability
		inventroy must not be negetive (so we must be using cp)
		no negative order

Functional requirement
1. user allow to add product to cart
2. in cart user can increase, decrese and delete unit items
3. user can filter product based on company, type of product(like buety, cloths, shoes, etc.), based on (kids mens and womens), price range
4. user can proceed to checkout confirm and pay
5. user can get confirmation email and msg for this we can use
6. can be added notify user when product availanle(optional)
7. system must have veriety of product 
8. must have inventroy


high level view
1. to move from add to cart->checkout->payment will use some state machine for it 
2. in payment as there can be lots of method of payment we will go with(creating diffrent stategy) strategy pattern
3. as while pyment there can be payment=> taxApplier=> discountApplier->paymentProcerssor so will crate chain between payments use chain of responsibility

enum prductType -> contains all the genere of product and will use them to figure out which type of product some product is

class product
	- productID   //same for same product
	- productName
	- productType
	- price
	
class user -> contains info of user
	- userName
	- userID
	- mobileNumber
	
class Order{};
	
class credentialVault
	- map<userID,password>  -> can be use some hashing on password since storing password directly can leads to break authentication also can be look to avoid sql injection like attacks
	
class authenticater -> authenitcate user
	- credentialVault
	- bool: authenticateUser(string userID) -> function to authentication logic

class Inventory
	- map<product*,int: cnt>
	
class Cart
	- map<string:userID,map<string:productID, int:cnt>>

class state
	- virtual void setNextState(state* nextState)
	- virtual void setPervState(state* prevState)

class Cart
	- string UserId
	- map<productId,int> 

class CartHandler: state
	- Cart* cart
	- state* nextState
	- state* prevState
	- opeartions to manage cart
	- proceedToCheckout

class Checkout: state
	- method to show total preoducts and price we can have inventory to do this
	- invenotry
	- state* nextState
	
class payment: state
	- we will create type of payments to choose by user
	- payAmount(double amount)
	
class COD: payment

class creditCardPayment: pyment

class UPI: pyment
